The models (rf/ann/transformer) were not pushed because they are too large for git!!!!!!!! >_< T_T 23333333333333333

Now they are hosted on huggingface :D 66666666666666666

Use "reproduce.py" if you don't have the models in genre/library/saved_models
Otherwise use "reproduce_nohug.py", which is the original one.

We need to add the huggingface-hub library to our environment to support fetching models from huggingface. 
pip install huggingface-hub==0.16.4
