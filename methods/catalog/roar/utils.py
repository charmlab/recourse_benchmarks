The purpose of this file is to hold
functions/replicas of functions from within this repo, particularly from the
ModelCatalog and DataCatalog classes.

Because accurate reproduction of the ROAR experiments would require
more fine-tuned control over the model training/creation process
along with the data preprocessing steps.
